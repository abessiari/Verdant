ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ± Verdant is a JupyterLab extension that automatically records history of all experiments you run in a Jupyter notebook, and stores them in a tidy .ipyhistory JSON file designed to be work alongside and compliment any other version control you use, like SVN or Git. Verdant also visualizes history of individual cells, code snippets, markdown, and outputs for you, for quick checks and references as you work.

Figure alt text: 
> The history tab opens the sidebar for Verdant containing three tabs: Activity, Artifacts, and Search. In the currently open Artifacts tab,
> the user click on a large button titled "Version Inspector". Once clicked, the inspector is active, and now when the user mouses over different
> parts of their notebook, cells and output highlight blue. The use mouses over a code cell and clicks it. The inspector opens up a full history of 
> that code cell with diff highlighting in the side bar of Verdant.

## Prerequisites

* JupyterLab

## Install

`jupyter labextension install verdant-history`

## Develop

For a development install, do the following in the repository directory:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

The last line installs Verdant as an extension and builds JupyterLab. It may take a minute. Upon a successful build, Jupyter Lab will launch in your browser window.

If you make modifications to the Verdant source code, you'll need to rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

If you plan on making lots of edits to Verdant, extension building is easier if you use:

```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```

and then each time you make a change, you'll only have to re-run:

```bash
yarn build
```
