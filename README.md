ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ± Verdant is a JupyterLab extension that automatically records history of all experiments you run in a Jupyter notebook, and stores them in a tidy .ipyhistory JSON file designed to be work alongside and compliment any other version control you use, like SVN or Git. Verdant also visualizes history of individual cells, code snippets, markdown, and outputs for you, for quick checks and references as you work.

Figure description: 
> The history tab opens the sidebar for Verdant containing three tabs: Activity (A), Artifacts (B), and Search
(C). The Activity tab, shown open here, displays a list of events. A date (D) can be opened or collapsed to see what
happened that day. Each row shows a version of the notebook (e.g. version #53) with a text description and visual minimap.
Thee minimap shows cells added in green (see G) and deleted in red (F). In (E), a cell was edited and run (in blue), and the
following cells were run but remained the same (in grey). The user can open any version (e.g., #53, H) in a ghost
notebook tab for quick reference.

## Prerequisites

* JupyterLab

## Install

`jupyter labextension install verdant-history`

## Develop

For a development install, do the following in the repository directory:

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

The last line installs Verdant as an extension and builds JupyterLab. It may take a minute. Upon a successful build, Jupyter Lab will launch in your browser window.

If you make modifications to the Verdant source code, you'll need to rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

If you plan on making lots of edits to Verdant, extension building is easier if you use:

```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```

and then each time you make a change, you'll only have to re-run:

```bash
yarn build
```
