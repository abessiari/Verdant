        ðŸŒ¿ Welcome! The goal of this getting started tutorial is to give you
        some hands-on practice understanding the edit history of a Jupyter
        notebook using Verdant. ðŸŒ¿
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Setup & Materials</h2>
        <p>
          For this tutorial you'll need Verdant installed in JupyterLab. We'll
          use a notebook <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> and its Verdant history
          file <code>houses_kc.ipyhistory</code>. Verdant stores output images,
          like plots or charts, in a seperate folder
          <code>houses_kc_output</code>. All of these materials can be
          downloaded as a zip file from the
          <a>GitHub repository tutorial folder</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> the author has been at work predicting
          housing prices in the Seattle area of the United States. In this
          tutorial, we'll use history to uncover different details of the
          analysis and the author's modeling choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If everything has loaded OK, you should see
          <b>Verdant's tree log icon</b> at the left. Click the log to open up
          Verdant. You should see an activity pane like below.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/setup2.png"
          />

      <div class="step">
        <h2>1. Get an overview of what has been done so far</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset in this analysis has a fair number of features to describe
          each property, from number of bathrooms to whether the house has a
          waterfront view. However, per the markdown shown below, the author of
          <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> seems to have picked just a single
          feature <code>sqft_living</code> for their first model.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step1.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Did the author explore any of the other features? One good way to get
          an overview is to take a peek at how this notebook has evolved over
          time. Using the <b>activity pane</b> (shown below) scroll down to the
          earliest version of the notebook. We can see from this that the author
          created 109 versions of the notebook over the span of about 1 hour.
          The <b>minimap</b> with the colorful ticks next to each version row
          shows us how the author started with just 1 cell and added, edited,
          and deleted cells over time.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step2.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Now try clicking on a version, like <b>v37</b> (shown below) to open
          the full notebook at that version as a <b>ghost notebook</b>:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step3.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The diff notation in the <b>ghost notebook</b> highlights what content
          was added (green), deleted (red), or edited (blue) in this version.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>2. See how the data features have been visualized</h2>
        <p>
          One way to figure this out is to head to the search tab of Verdant and
          type in "plot"
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img

          />
        </div>

      <div class="step">
