        ðŸŒ¿ Welcome! The goal of this getting started tutorial is to give you
        some hands-on practice understanding the edit history of a Jupyter
        notebook using Verdant. ðŸŒ¿
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>Setup & Materials</h2>
        <p>
          For this tutorial you'll need Verdant installed in JupyterLab. We'll
          use a notebook <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> and its Verdant history
          file <code>houses_kc.ipyhistory</code>. Verdant stores output images,
          like plots or charts, in a seperate folder
          <code>houses_kc_output</code>. All of these materials can be
          downloaded as a zip file from the
          <a>GitHub repository tutorial folder</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> the author has been at work predicting
          housing prices in the Seattle area of the United States. In this
          tutorial, we'll use history to uncover different details of the
          analysis and the author's modeling choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If everything has loaded OK, you should see
          <b>Verdant's tree log icon</b> at the left. Click the log to open up
          Verdant. You should see an activity pane like below.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Get an overview of what has been done so far</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset in this analysis has a fair number of features to describe
          each property. However, the author of
          <code>houses_kc.ipynb</code> seems to have picked just a single
          feature <code>sqft_living</code> for their first model:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step1.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Did the author explore any of the other features? One good way to get
          an overview is to take a peek at how this notebook has evolved over
          time. Using the <b>activity pane</b> (shown below) scroll down to the
          earliest version of the notebook.
        </p>

        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"

        </div>
        <div class="QA">
          <p class="question">
            Question: Looking at the earliest version, what date and time did
            the author first start working on this notebook?
          </p>

          The <b>notebook minimap</b> with the colorful ticks next to each
          version row shows us which cells changed in a given notebook version.
          Green indicates a cell added, red a cell deleted, blue a cell changed,
          and so on.
        </p>
        <div class="QA">
          <p class="question">
            Question: Use your mouse to hover over the vertical line tick in the
            minimap for <b>v19</b>. Which cell was changed in v19 and how?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">Code cell 7 was added</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Now let's get back to figuring out what the author tried in this
          analysis. Try clicking on a version <b>v37</b> (shown below) to open
          the full notebook at that version as a <b>ghost notebook</b>:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step3.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          The diff notation in the <b>ghost notebook</b> highlights what content
          was added (green), deleted (red), or edited (blue) in this version.
          Next, try using the arrows at the top of the ghost book to move ahead
          in time a couple of versions, and watch how the notebook changes:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="width: 50em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/overview_step4.png"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="QA">
          <p class="question">
            Question: Glance through versions v37 to v50 of the notebook. Other
            than sqft_living, what are 2 other features the author plotted
            compared to price?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">zipcode, bedrooms, or bathrooms</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Hopefully you've spotted a few charts in these versions, however it's
          a bit tedious to skim one at a time though versions. Next let's learn
          some strategies to more directly find specific things from history!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>2. Track model improvements</h2>
        <p>
          For this notebook, it would be helpful to know what kind of model
          performance the author has gotten so far for predicting house prices.
          What kind of models have they tried and what were their results?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few ways in Verdant to find specific history. Head over to
          the Artifacts tab, where you should see a table like this:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            class="verdant-screenshot"
            style="height: 30em"
            src="./images/Screenshots/Tutorial-Housing/artifact_table.png"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          For each cell & output in your current notebook, this table lists how
          many versions exist of that cell. Cells are abbreviated <b>C</b> for
          code and <b>M</b> for markdown. Each cell has a number that identifies
          it, like <b>C2</b>. This id is unique, permanent, and never changes,
          so that you can always recover a specific cell even after it's been
          deleted.
        </p>
        <div class="QA">
          <p class="question">
            Question: How many versions exist for C4 (Code Cell 4)?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">33</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h2>3. Review data visualizations</h2>
        <p>
          There are several ways to get an overview of past data visualizations
          in Verdant. One way to figure this out is to head over to the search
          tab of Verdant and type in "plot".
